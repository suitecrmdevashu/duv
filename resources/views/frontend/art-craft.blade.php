            <p class="pb-3">Art and Craft as a subject of curriculum is generally taken for granted as an entitlement for children in formal education. In the context of formal education, the subject supports personal, social, moral, spiritual, cultural and creative development of the children and enables them to explore visual tactile and other sensory experience to recognize and communicate ideas and meanings. These opportunities enable them to work with traditional and various new mediums so that they develop confidence, competence, imagination and creativity.<br><br>

            This subject introduces children to a range of intellectual and practical skills as well as helps them to learn the use of different tools, materials and machines. It provides children an opportunity to think imaginatively and creatively and even develop confidence in other subjects too. Moreover it works as a therapy that can yield lifelong benefits in health and well-being. Children may find it enjoyable, motivating and helpful in developing a positive attitude to school and life beyond formal education. <br> <br>
